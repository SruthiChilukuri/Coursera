# Heart Failure prediction using Machine Learning

Heart failure prediction model using Machine leraning:
* Visualisation and preliminary Data exploration using plotly.express
* Scaling features to introduce uniformity in the dataset and avoid model getting biased- MinMax scalar.
* Applying stratified sampling technique to solve the class imbalance.
* Applying Logistic regression and Ensemble technique gradient boost algorithm.
* Results and discussions including confusion matrix analysis.
